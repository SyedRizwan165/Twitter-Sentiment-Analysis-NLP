# Twitter Sentiment Analysis - NLP

# Dataset Information

The aim of this task is to identify hate speech within tweets. Specifically, tweets expressing racist or sexist sentiments are considered to contain hate speech. The task entails classifying tweets as either containing or not containing such sentiments.

We are provided with a training dataset comprising 31,962 tweets, each accompanied by a label. A label of '1' indicates the presence of racist/sexist sentiment in the tweet, while a label of '0' denotes its absence. 
The objective is to develop a model using this labeled data to predict the labels for tweets in a separate test dataset.

The dataset is structured as a CSV file, with each row containing a tweet ID, its corresponding label, and the tweet text which is taken from https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-twitter-sentiment-analysis/
